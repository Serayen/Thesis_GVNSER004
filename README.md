State-Space models for plant diversity in the Karoo

Notes for Code:
-In exploratory analyses there is code to set up data into counts of species over time. 

-Can run the code in exploratory analyses to get data in species counts then save data to be used in Species modeling.

-R objects to call data for each species is contained within Data. 

-Each species modeled in its own R code. Renosterveld species have a univariate interaction model, denoted by _thesium.

-Two multivariate models are provided to for species at each site.

-There is sometimes reference to loading an SSM object. These objects cannot be saved in this repository but results can be reproduced by running the code.

-Remember to change working directories.
